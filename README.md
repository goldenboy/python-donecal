About
-----

This package makes it easy to use the restful HTTP API on
http://donecal.com/

All you need is your `guid` which you can pick up on
http://donecal.com/help/API once you have created an account.

Limitations
-----------

At the moment there are rate limitations but there might be some time
in the future to ensure fair access for everyone.
